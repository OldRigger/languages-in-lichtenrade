Yes.

## 3. WHAT IS IT?

25% of class tuition is non-refundable. The remainder is pro-rated by amount of class attended and returned by forcing you to dance to Parliament's "Give Up The Funk (Tear The Roof Off The Sucker)" and stuffing single bills in your underwear while you cry.

That's not a question.

## 5. I'M SORRY. I MEANT TO TEXT THAT TO SOMEONE ELSE.
